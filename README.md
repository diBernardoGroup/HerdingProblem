# HerdingProblem

This repository contains the code used in the paper: 

> F. Auletta, D. Fiore, M.J. Richardson, M. di Bernardo "Herding stochastic autonomous agents via local control rules and online global target selection strategies",  https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00386v2 , Submitted, 2020

* The folder [MATLAB simulations/](MATLAB simulations/) contains the Matlab functions and scripts for initializing and simulating the herding task for different target selection strategies for both fixed and variable system conditions (i.e., to test system robustness systematically). It also contains the Matlab functions for computing the performance metrics. 

* The folder [ROS simulations/](ROS simulations/) contains files and scripts for launching and running Gazebo-ROS simulations of the herding for different target selection strategies.

Movies of two illustrative trials of the experiments conducted on [Robotarium](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) are also made available for download.
