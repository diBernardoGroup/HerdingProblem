# HerdingProblem

This repository contains the code used in the paper: 

> F. Auletta, D. Fiore, M.J. Richardson, M. di Bernardo "Herding stochastic autonomous agents via local control rules and online global target selection strategies",  https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00386v2 , Submitted, 2020

* The folder `MATLAB simulations` contains the Matlab functions and scripts for initializing and simulating the herding task for different target selection strategies. It also contains the Matlab functions for computing the performance metrics. 

* The folder `ROS simulations` contains files and scripts for launching and running Gazebo-ROS simulations of the herding for different target selection strategies. 


----- 



Movies of two illustrative trials of the experiments condicted on Robotarium [1] are also made available for download.
